      <h3 id="faq1">What is Easy Bid's Mission?</h3>
      <p>Our objective is to transform the Federal Government contracts process so that the process is as streamlines as possible for both the government and industry. We serve as the pivotable partner that takes on the administrative workload so that our partners can focus on fulfilling the requirements that push our great nation forward. Our nimble solutions and innovative approaches are served to comliment your teams. This symbioic relationship maximizes value and allows both sides to further capability.</p>

      <h3 id="faq2">What type of contracts do you work with?</h3>
      <p>Easy Bid Solutions is focused on assting its clients with Federal Government contracts. We are primarily focused on Department of Defense (DoD) contracts. However, our services have been successfully used to bid on contracts across the Federal Government, such as the U.S. State Department, Deparment of Energy (DOE), General Service Administration (GSA), and many more.</p>

      <h3 id="faq3">What industry partners do we serve?</h3>
      <p>We serve firms of all sectors and sizes, but we do have a speciality. We concentrate our effots of Small Businesses (SB), Women Owned Small Businesses (WOSB), Veteran-Owned Small Business (VOSB), and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB).</p>

      <h3 id="faq4">How does Easy Bid Solutions help us bid on contracts?</h3>
      <p>The recipe to success is predicated on our integrated platform. As our partner, you create your account profile and fill out your applicable company information. The platform then computes the information that you can apply for and identifies the legal requirements your firm needs to satisfy to ensure a successful bid. On top to that, our consultants will provide hands on expertise to assist you with every step.</p>

      <h3 id="faq5">Can the government see our work?</h3>
      <p>The relationship between the Federal Government and industry is predicated on trust. That is why the Easy Bid platform works as a two way street for both government and our partners. We like to show off our partner's wins, and the platform helps provide goverment an overview of the great work and products that highlight the services and items your teams produce.</p>

      <h3 id="faq6">What is government contract consulting?</h3>
      <p>Generally, we act as business consultants. This work inludes but is not limited to data analysis, modeling, document development, and financial forecasting. We don't just want our partners to win contracts, we also want our clients to increase their bottom line. Bottom Line Up Front (BLUF), we provide strategic advice that ensures our clients are profitable, adherent to the strict contract requirements, and assisting with identifying new opportunities to grow your businesses through strategic ventures.</p>

      <h3 id="faq7">As a consultant for Easy Bid, what travel expectations can I expect with the position?</h3>
      <p>In our globally connected environment it is easier than ever to provide expertise no matter where your home base is located. However, we also recognize that the value in putitng a face to a name can't be replicated. Travel is sporadic and highly dependent on client needs to get things off the ground and running. As a general rule of thumb, team members can expect to travel 10%-20% through the year.</p>

      <h3 id="faq8">What is Cost Accounting Standards, and who does it apply to?</h3>
      <p>CAS is applicable to any comapny that received greater than or equal to $50M within the last accounting period. A disclosure statement is required by the federal government and something that we help with! The CAS code breakou is provided in 48 CFR Chapter 99 and esnures that costs paid for by the government are properly tracked and identified.</p>
